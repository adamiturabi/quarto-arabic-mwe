# Introduction

In order to create a Quarto book project (like this one), use this command:

```sh
quarto create project book mybook
```

where `mybook` is the name of your project.

It will create a bunch of files that will be needed for the book.

This procedure is described in detail here: <https://quarto.org/docs/books/>.

In the next chapter we will explain how Quarto needs text to be input in order to render Arabic correctly. 
If you wish to avoid the technical discussion, and just want to know what to do, skip ahead to @sec-summary.
